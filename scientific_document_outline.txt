## Title
- Detecting Spoofed Text in Large Language Models: An Experiment with DetectGPT and Watermarking

## Abstract
- This document presents the methodology, experiment, and findings of testing the DetectGPT model's ability to differentiate between text generated by a 'victim' model with a KGW watermark and a 'spoof' model designed to mimic the watermark.

## Introduction
- The introduction will provide background on the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the importance of detecting machine-generated text, and the role of watermarking schemes in ensuring the authenticity of generated content.

## Related Works
### Watermarking Schemes
- This section will provide an overview of watermarking schemes in LLMs, with a focus on the KGW watermark. It will discuss the principles behind watermarking, its importance for content verification, and the challenges it faces, such as vulnerability to spoofing attacks.

### DetectGPT and its Variants
- An introduction to DetectGPT will be provided, explaining its purpose in the detection of machine-generated text. The literature review will cover DetectGPT's effectiveness, limitations, and the advancements made by its variants. The section will also highlight the gaps in the literature that the current experiment addresses, such as the need for robust detection methods that can withstand sophisticated spoofing attempts.

### Advances in Large Language Models
- This section will discuss the advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and ChatGPT, and their implications for generating convincing text. It will also cover the challenges of overfitting in models trained explicitly for text detection and the development of various detection methods, including supervised models and zero-shot methods.

### Challenges and Contemporaneous Work in LLM Output Detection
- The widespread use of LLMs has led to much other contemporaneous work on detecting LLM output. This section will summarize various studies that show the limitations of detection methods and the potential for evasion through paraphrasing. It will also discuss the challenges of multilingual detection and biases against non-native speakers, emphasizing the advantage of zero-shot detectors like DetectGPT, which generalize well to any data generated by the original model.

## Methodology
- This section will describe the experimental setup and procedures in detail, including the selection of the 'victim' and 'spoof' models, the application of the KGW watermark, and the fine-tuning process.

## Experiment Results
- Findings from the experiment will be presented, including data analysis and metrics such as True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) for harmful and non-harmful texts.

## Discussion
- The results will be interpreted in the context of the current state of LLM text detection, discussing the implications of the findings and potential areas for future research.

## Conclusion
- A summary of the research, its contributions to the field, and the significance of the findings in advancing the reliability of LLM text detection methods.
